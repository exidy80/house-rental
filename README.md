# Home Rental Project

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application designed to demonstrate house rentals. As an experienced developer decades of programming experience, I created this project to explore and learn Next.js, building on my extensive knowledge in various languages and techniques.

Unlike following a pre-existing tutorial, I crafted this project and its exercises myself, adding unique features like filtering rentals, detailed views, and map integration.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying \`app/page.js\`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [\`next/font\`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About the Project

This home rental website allows users to browse through available rentals, search and filter by specific features, and view detailed information for each rental. Integrating map visuals using latitude and longitude, it offers an interactive user experience.
